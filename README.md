This is the official repository of the vector2image challenge!

You should modify only the vector2image_DWT function <b>OR</b> vector2image_CWT function inside the game.ipynb notebook.

The notebook will use functions from the utils/ folder and the data from the datasets/ folder.

Then, upload your function (either just the function or the full notebook) to the DropBox link that you find the instruction in the moodle.
You must deliver also a short and simple report that describes your solution and the performance.

If you have any doubt, contact us!

## Requirements

1) You should use an Ubuntu system (from 18.04 to 24.04 are fine)

2) It's better if you setup a virtual environment (follow these steps)

```shell
# Install git, Python 3 and venv
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git python3 python3-venv python3-pip -y 

# Clone this repo
cd /path/to/your/project  
git clone https://github.com/Bender97/vector2image_game.git

# Create a Virtual Environment
python3 -m venv venv      # Creates a virtual environment named 'venv'

# Activate it
source venv/bin/activate

# Update pip
pip install --upgrade pip

# Install torch (PAY ATTENTION to your CUDA version! e.g., here is Cuda 11.8)
# If in doubt, follow
#  - for latest version:    https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
#  - for previous versions: https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/
pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118

# Install all requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt

```
