This is the official repository of the vector2image challenge!

You should modify only the vector2image_DWT function <b>OR</b> vector2image_CWT function inside the game.ipynb notebook.

The notebook will use functions from the utils/ folder and the data from the datasets/ folder.

Then, upload your function (either just the function or the full notebook) to the DropBox link that you find the instruction in the moodle.
You must deliver also a short and simple report that describes your solution and the performance.

If you have any doubt, contact us!
